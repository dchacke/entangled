#### [See what's new in v1.0](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#chokidar-100-rc1-21-january-2015)

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on OS X.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on OS X.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/joyent/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Other node.js watching libraries:

* Are not using ultra-fast non-polling fsevents watcher implementation on OS X

Chokidar resolves these problems.

It is used in
[brunch](http://brunch.io),
[karma](http://karma-runner.github.io),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[socketstream](http://www.socketstream.org),
[derby](http://derbyjs.com/),
[watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## Getting started
Install chokidar via node.js package manager:

    npm install chokidar

Then just require the package in your code:

```javascript
var chokidar = require('chokidar');

var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, or glob', {
  ignored: /[\/\\]\./, persistent: true
});

var log = console.log.bind(console);

watcher
  .on('add', function(path) { log('File', path, 'has been added'); })
  .on('addDir', function(path) { log('Directory', path, 'has been added'); })
  .on('change', function(path) { log('File', path, 'has been changed'); })
  .on('unlink', function(path) { log('File', path, 'has been removed'); })
  .on('unlinkDir', function(path) { log('Directory', path, 'has been removed'); })
  .on('error', function(error) { log('Error happened', error); })
  .on('ready', function() { log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes.'); })
  .on('raw', function(event, path, details) { log('Raw event info:', event, path, details); })

// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second
// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', function(path, stats) {
  if (stats) console.log('File', path, 'changed size to', stats.size);
});

// Watch new files.
watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);

// Un-watch some files.
watcher.unwatch('new-file*');

// Only needed if watching is `persistent: true`.
watcher.close();

// One-liner
require('chokidar').watch('.', {ignored: /[\/\\]\./}).on('all', function(event, path) {
  console.log(event, path);
});

```

## API

`chokidar.watch(paths, options)` â€” takes one or more paths (which may be paths to files,
  dirs to be watched recursively, or glob patterns) and options:

#### Persistence

* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.

#### Path filtering

* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The **whole path** is tested, not just
filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it gets called
twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second time with
two arguments (the path and the [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object of that path).
* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). Indicates whether chokidar
should ignore the initial `add` events or not.
* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.

#### Performance

* `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling.
* `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
polling for binary files (see extensions in src/is-binary).
* `usePolling` (default: `false`).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. Polling
may be necessary to successfully watch files in certain situation, such as
network mounted drives. Setting to `true` explicitly on OS X overrides the
`useFsEvents` default.
* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on OS X). Whether to use the
`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
set to `false` on OS X, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.
* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.

#### Errors
* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates
whether to watch files that don't have read permissions.
* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
"atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file.

### Methods & Events

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`, `raw`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event name
and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.
